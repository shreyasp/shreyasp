## Work Experience

#### [HousingAnywhere B.V. \(Netherlands\)](https://housinganywhere.com)
* As part of the Platform Infrastructure team, designed and executed the migration of the database instances from virtual machines to Cloud-native databases (i.e., GCP CloudSQL) instances with a near-zero downtime migration process, the migration helped reduce the costs by 5 percent associated with maintaining database servers hosted in the virtual machines.
* Developed a script using Grafana K6 to establish web vitals and application performance benchmarks. Utilized the script to investigate and document the effects after migrating to Cloud-native databases.
* Developed a playbook to facilitate zero-downtime SQL version upgrades for product teams.
* Contributed to the internal code generator toolchain for Go applications, which allowed the product teams to streamline and standardize the coding conventions.
* Designed, implemented, and deployed the Notifications microservice, capable of handling 1 million monthly notifications (viz., emails, SMS, and Whatsapp) to decouple the notifications flow from the legacy monolith application.
* Designed and implemented the subscription service by integrating with Stripe as a third-party provider, allowing the organization to update the business model from commission-based to subscription-based revenue in the Netherlands. This change aided in aligning the revenue model with Kamernet, which HousingAnywhere acquired at the time.
* Designed and implemented a feature that allowed users to advertise on the platform to leverage seasonal pricing for their property, which, in turn, helped improve organizational revenue by increasing commissions from these users using higher pricing for a specific period.

#### [RedHat India Pvt Ltd](https://redhat.com)
* Managed a team of 10 developers (Frontend and Backend) based in Bejing, China, and Pune, India, responsible for the development and maintenance of Red Hat’s tools for assisting Hardware (IHV) and Software (ISV) vendors to certify their offerings against Red Hat’s compliance policies.
* Streamlined and Standardized the processes with the Product and Program Management team to have predictable workloads, ensuring the team can avoid scope creeps and reduce delivery delays.
* Designed and implemented a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) to evaluate and document the best possible solution to transition Python Django-based Frontend pages to React through an incremental replacement approach.
* Designed the wizard-based search feature to improve the user experience and enable the user to find RedHat-compliant hardware in the Red Hat Ecosystem Catalog. Was rewarded with the Customer Champion award for successfully delivering the feature to complement the RedHat Linux 8 release.
* Worked as a contributor and maintainer of the Python-based repository meant for RedHat partners to evaluate their hardware and software against the compliance policy outlined for RedHat Linux.
 
#### [Servify](https://servify.com)
* Deployed and maintained the on-premises GitLab instance to ensure the team can reduce the GitHub subscription costs to zero and allow the creation of private repositories with better access control.
* Designed and developed the application to sync the device catalog from a third-party provider containing information related to various devices and appliances (viz., mobiles, laptops, and home appliances).
* Designed and developed REST API in Django to expose the device catalog to front-end applications (viz., mobile and desktop)
* Worked on Proof-of-Concept (PoC) to utilize Elastic Search as an information retrieval layer to allow searching through the device catalog based on different parameters (viz., warranty, end-of-support, and service locations, to mention a few).

#### [Frappe Technologies Pvt Ltd.](https://frappe.io)
* Designed and developed ERPNext Premium Cloud offerings deployment process using Ansible for provisioning and configuration management, with Frappe UI framework as the front end. The YAML-based ansible definitions replaced complex Python-based scripts, simplifying the deployment process.
* Worked with the community to prioritize feature requests, pull request reviews, and bugs that needed attention to ensure the best possible experience for the users of ERPNext and Frappe.
* Worked as a maintainer for the discourse instance, which hosted the ERPNext and Frappe discussion forum.
